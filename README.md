# Truchet Tiles

[Tuchet Tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles) are
small quadratic Tiles with a simple pattern. Placing them with
a (random) rotation in a greater grid will produce a new pattern.
One base tile can create mutiple patterns.

This page demonstrates some of these patterns. A simple editor
allows a new arrangement of the tiles to create a new pattern.
